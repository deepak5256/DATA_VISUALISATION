This commit introduces the Data Visualization project, a Maven-based Java application for creating and analyzing graphical representations of data.

Key Features:
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Supports various chart types like bar, pie, and scatter plots.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Allows users to upload datasets and interact with generated visualizations.
- **Customizable Output**: Includes options to filter data and export visuals.

Files Added:
- Source Code: Located in the `src` directory.
- Build Artifacts: Precompiled `.jar` or `.war` files in the `target` directory.
- Maven Configuration: `pom.xml` for dependency management and build processes.

Setup Instructions:
- Use Maven to compile and package the project.
- Run the `.jar` directly or deploy the `.war` file to a web server like Tomcat.
- Access the application locally or through a browser.

This project highlights the power of Java for data analysis, providing a robust and flexible tool for visualizing datasets.
